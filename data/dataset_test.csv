The Fool on the Hill;Day after day, alone on the hill The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still But nobody wants to know him They can see that he's just a fool And he never gives an answer  But the fool on the hill Sees the sun going down And the eyes in his head See the world spinning around  Well on the way, head in a cloud The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud But nobody ever hears him Or the sound he appears to make And he never seems to notice  But the fool on the hill Sees the sun going down And the eyes in his head See the world spinning around  And nobody seems to like him They can tell what he wants to do And he never shows his feelings  But the fool on the hill Sees the sun going down And the eyes in his head See the world spinning around  He never listens to them He knows that they're the fools They don't like him  The fool on the hill Sees the sun going down And the eyes in his head See the world spinning around  ;0
