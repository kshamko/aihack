The Luck Of The Irish (Live); If you had the luck of the Irish||You'd be sorry and wish you were dead||You should have the luck of the Irish||And you'd wish you was English instead!||A thousand years of torture and hunger||Drove the people away from their land||A land full of beauty and wonder||Was raped by the British brigands! Goddamn! Goddamn!||If you could keep voices like flowers||There'd be shamrock all over the world||If you could drink dreams like Irish streams||Then the world would be high as the mountain of morn||In the 'Pool they told us the story||How the English divided the land||Of the pain, the death and the glory||And the poets of auld Eireland||If we could make chains with the morning dew||The world would be like Galway Bay||Let's walk over rainbows like leprechauns||The world would be one big Blarney stone||Why the hell are the English there anyway?||As they kill with God on their side||Blame it all on the kids the IRA||As the bastards commit genocide! Aye! Aye! Genocide!||If you had the luck of the Irish||You'd be sorry and wish you was dead||You should have the luck of the Irish||And you'd wish you was English instead!||Yes you'd wish you was English instead!||; 1
