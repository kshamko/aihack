Cold Turkey; Temperature's rising||Fever is high||Can't see no future||Can't see no sky||My feet are so heavy||So is my head||I wish I was a baby||I wish I was dead||Cold turkey has got me on the run||My body is aching||Goose-pimple bone||Can't see no body||Leave me alone||My eyes are wide open||Can't get to sleep||One thing I'm sure of||I'm in at the deep freeze||Cold turkey has got me on the run||Cold turkey has got me on the run||Thirty-six hours||Rolling in pain||Praying to someone||Free me again||Oh I'll be a good boy||Please make me well||I promise you anything||Get me out of this hell||Cold turkey has got me on the run||Oh, oh, oh, oh||; 1
The Luck Of The Irish (Live); If you had the luck of the Irish||You'd be sorry and wish you were dead||You should have the luck of the Irish||And you'd wish you was English instead!||A thousand years of torture and hunger||Drove the people away from their land||A land full of beauty and wonder||Was raped by the British brigands! Goddamn! Goddamn!||If you could keep voices like flowers||There'd be shamrock all over the world||If you could drink dreams like Irish streams||Then the world would be high as the mountain of morn||In the 'Pool they told us the story||How the English divided the land||Of the pain, the death and the glory||And the poets of auld Eireland||If we could make chains with the morning dew||The world would be like Galway Bay||Let's walk over rainbows like leprechauns||The world would be one big Blarney stone||Why the hell are the English there anyway?||As they kill with God on their side||Blame it all on the kids the IRA||As the bastards commit genocide! Aye! Aye! Genocide!||If you had the luck of the Irish||You'd be sorry and wish you was dead||You should have the luck of the Irish||And you'd wish you was English instead!||Yes you'd wish you was English instead!||; 1
