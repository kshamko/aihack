London Town; Walking down the sidewalk one purple afternoon,||I was accosted by a barker playing a simple tune upon his flute.||Toottoottoottoot.||Silver rain was falling down||Upon the dirty ground of london town.||People pass me by on my imaginary street,||Ordinary people it's impossible to meet,||Holding conversations that are always incomplete.||Well i don't know.||Oh, where are there places to go?||Someone, somewhere has to know.||I'don't know.||Out of work again,the actor entertains his wife||With the same old stories of his ordinary life.||Maybe he exaggerates the trouble and the strife.||Well, i don't know.||Oh, where are there places to go?||Someone, somewhere has to know.||Crawling down the pavement on a sunday afternoon,||I was arrested by a rozzer||Wearing a pink balloon about his foot.||Toot toot toot toot.||Silver rain was falling down||Upon the dirty ground of london town.||Someone, somewhere has to know.||Silver rain was falling down||Upon the dirty ground of london town.||; 0
